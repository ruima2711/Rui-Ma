#Week 4: dplyr package

#Task: Write the function to get a dataset from Base R: Titanic
#and give the dataframe a new name of your choice
#(hint: you will want your data to be a dataframe. Use the function: as.data.frame(Titanic))

titanic_df <- as.data.frame(Titanic)

#See the top rows of the data
#TASK: Write the function to see the top rows of the data

head(titanic_df)

#Install and call the package dplyr
#TASK: Write the functions to install and call dplyr

#install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

#Let's just see the Survived and Sex columns
#Task: Write the function to 'select' the Survived and Sex columns 
#(hint: use the 'select' function)

selected_cols <- select(titanic_df, Survived, Sex)

#Let's name the dataset with just the two columns, Survived and Sex
#TASK: Write the function to save the two columns as one new dataset
#and give it a name

selected_dataset <- selected_cols

#Let's get rid of the Sex column in the new dataset created above
#TASK: Write the function that deselects the sex column
#(hint: use the 'select' function to not select a -column)
selected_dataset <- select(selected_dataset, -Sex)
#Let's rename a column name
#TASK: Write the function that renames 'Sex' to 'Gender'

selected_dataset <- rename(selected_dataset, Gender = Sex)

#Let's make a new dataframe with the new column name
#TASK: Write the function that names a new dataset that includes the 'gender' column

gender_dataset <- selected_dataset

#Let's 'filter' just the males from our dataset
#TASK: Write the function that includes only rows that are 'male'
males_dataset <- filter(gender_dataset, Gender == "male")
#Let's 'arrange' our data by gender (not the data you just filtered)
#TASK: Write the function to group the data by gender (hint: arrange())

arranged_dataset <- arrange(gender_dataset, Gender)

#Let's see how many people were examined in the dataset (total the frequency in the original dataframe)
#TASK: Sum the Freq column
#TASK: After you run it, write the total here:____

total_people_examined <- sum(titanic_df$Freq)
cat("Total people examined:", total_people_examined, "\n")

#Since we have a males dataset, let's make a females dataset
#TASK: Write the function that includes only rows that are 'female'

females_dataset <- filter(gender_dataset, Gender == "female")

#And now let's join the males and females
#TASK: Write the function that joins the male and female rows 
#(hint: try using 'union' or 'bind_rows')

combined_dataset <- bind_rows(males_dataset, females_dataset)

#Optional Task: add any of the other functions 
#you learned about from the dplyr package

gender_dataset <- mutate(gender_dataset,
                         Survived_Status = case_when(Survived == 1 ~ "Survived",
                                                     Survived == 0 ~ "Did not survive",
                                                     TRUE ~ "Unknown"))
